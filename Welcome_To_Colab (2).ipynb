        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: This is the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, or class. Encapsulation helps restrict direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent unintended interference and misuse of the data. It is implemented using access modifiers (public, private, protected).\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: This concept involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary parts to the user. It allows the programmer to focus on a simplified version of the system's behavior without needing to understand its internal workings. In OOP, this is often achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and a hierarchical class structure. The child class can add new features or override inherited methods to enhance or modify its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single function or method to work with objects of different types. There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition: This involves creating complex objects by combining simpler objects. Instead of using inheritance to build relationships between classes, composition is used to create \"has-a\" relationships, where one object contains another. It enhances flexibility and reusability and avoids issues that arise from deep inheritance chains.\n",
        "\n",
        "These principles help in organizing code in a modular and reusable way, making it easier to maintain and scale software systems."
